          <p>
            In 2022, when i was a senior student at university, i started to
            improve myself in the field of software by learning the Python
            language and taking courses such as Image Processing and Algorithm
            Development. After graduation, i developed my frontend skills with
            online courses in a 6 months period. At this point, i am successful
            about creating, interactive and salient websites with React.js. I
            don't have a working life background but i'm an enthusiastic person
            who would like to work in this field.
